# Arkansas Acute Behavioral Health Events Dashboard

## About the project
Behavioral health conditions, including mental health and substance abuse diagnoses, can be chronic and impact a patient’s well-being in many ways. When unmanaged or in severe cases, these conditions can become acute, resulting in an emergency department (ED) visit or requiring an inpatient stay.
Arkansas Center for Health Improvement (ACHI) developed an interactive dashboard that allows policymakers, healthcare providers, and community leaders to research acute behavioral health events in Arkansas at the state and county levels, better understand the behavioral health landscape, and explore opportunities to improve care. This project linked, cleaned, and created the final datasets to generate the dashboard.

## About the data
The data used in this project were obtained through the Arkansas Healthcare Transparency Initiative (HTI), which includes the Arkansas All-Payer Claims Database (APCD). The APCD includes enrollment records and medical and pharmacy claims for commercial plans, Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS), Medicaid-qualified health plans, Medicaid Provider-led Arkansas Shared Savings Entity (PASSE) plans, and Medicare Advantage plans. The HTI also contains emergency department and inpatient data identified as “self-pay,” meaning that the payment source was out-of-pocket.
“Behavioral health” includes mental health diagnoses, developmental disorders, and substance use disorders, among others. Acute behavioral health events are defined as those that result in an ED visit or inpatient stay.

## Study participants
All claims where the member was seen in the Emergency Department or had an Inpatient stay where the primary diagnosis was identified as either a behavioral health diagnosis or a substance abuse diagnosis included those members in the study population.
All hospital and emergency discharges where the individual was seen in the Emergency Department or had an Inpatient Stay where the primary diagnosis at discharge was identified as either a behavioral health diagnosis or a substance abuse diagnosis and that had a payment source that indicated self-pay were included in the study population.

## Research questions
The following research questions were evaluated in this project:
1. How many inpatient stays and ED events had primary diagnoses in behavioral health or substance abuse categories from Jan 2020 through Dec 2023?
2. How many individuals were in those events?
3. What did the demographic profile of that population look like?
4. What did their outpatient behavioral health care look like in the time before their IP/ED event and in the time after their IP/ED event? 
5. What did the demographic profile of those who received ED/IP care for behavioral health or substance abuse without insurance (potential “uncompensated care”) look like?
6. What were the county's IP readmission rates following a BH IP or ED visit?  What were their ED rates following a BH IP or ED visit?
